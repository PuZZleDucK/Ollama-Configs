#  codex:
#  config-devstral-24b:latest: tools supported
#  responds with continuation, but errors in tool calls
#  or denied even having tools :p

# roo:
#  clear architech instructions
#  good architech checklist (and actually a checklist)
#  good file tool use
#  some code agents wrote docs, some wrote tests
#  going well when context hit 32k - condensed successfully
#  ran tests and game to verify
#  second condense required
#  completed project 🏅
#  - not a great map
#  - odd size of player
#  - collision detection not working?
#  - fell over writing the docs
#  - orchestrator finally declared victory
# roo-html:
#  checked node and npm versions
#  installed vscode extentions
#  used git... got stuck in a loop writing the .gitignore
#  project looks promising but shows nothing and has invalid image file
#  some wrote docs
#  often ran the tests and got them passing
#  requires frequent condencing
#  declared it finished with an empty page
#  prompted for fix
#  finally got it running
#  collision detection didn't work
